# Milestone of the project

The idea is to check one of the following elements everyday.

- [ ] Write test
     - [ ] routes.rest_api/get-user
     - [ ] routes.rest_api/new-user
	 - [ ] routes.rest_api/login
	 - [ ] routes.rest_api/change-values
	 - [ ] routes.rest_api/authorization
- [ ] Email send namespace
     - [ ] Adapt the other email send namespace that I have
     - [ ] Write test
- [ ] Connect to an email service, [mandrill][1]
- [ ] Port to Liberator
     - [ ] routes.rest_api/confirm-code
     - [ ] routes.rest_api/change
- [ ] Consider if is good to keep compojure, possible alternative is [bidi][2], 
- [ ] Refactor model.user
     - [ ] Find what is necessary to do
- [ ] Write test for model.user
- [ ] Write the routes as an actual REST service
